HTTP FUNDAMENTALS

Hypertext Transfer Protocol(HTTP)
	Invented by Tim Berners- Lee
	jointly developed by W3c and the IETF(Internet Engineering Task Force)
	HTTP 0.9(!991) Originally made by Tim Berners-Lee
		-one way to get a request by "Get" was developed on this era
	HTTP 1.0 (RFC 1995) May 1996
	HTTP 1.1 (RFC 2068, RFC 2616) January 1997, June 1999
	7230-7235(June 8 1999)
	HTTP 2 (RFC 7540 May 2015)-->SPDY-->by Google-->backwards compatible

Characteristics of a Protocol
	TCP/IP--> main communication layer
	Assigned to port 80 --> range of port is 0-64K
	is based on a client-server architechture
	clients a.k.a user agent(UA)--> web browsers, web crawlers, etc. tools & aps
	Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), ICANN
	Socket --> (Port + IP address)
	HTTPS --> is for encrypted communication --> port 443
	*Servers are usually an Origin Server(OS)
	HTTP --> uses request-response standard protocol
		client sends an HTTP Request message to the server -->"pull" & "poll"(e.g. regular check)
		server process --> HTTP Response Message 'push" --> HTTP 2 --> server can notify
	HTTP is a stateless communications protocols --> servers do not keep info
	HTTP provides support for other functionalities such as:
		cache control
		content media type(MIME) specifications --> Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions
		language & character set specification
		content / transfer codings
		content negotiation
		*NOTE: the 5 functionalities said above says that --> there has to be an agreement between client & server
		client-server protocol negotiations
		persistent connections **** This two functionalities was introduced on 1.1
		request pipelining		*** and push protocol was introduced on HTTP 2
		authentication/authorization
