                        <li><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;	The Hypertext Transfer Protocol is an application-level protocol with the lightness and speed necessary for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. Practical Information System require more functionality than simple retrieval, including search, front-end update, and annotation. HTTP allows an open-ended set of methods to be used to indicate the purpose of a request. It builds on the discipline of reference provided by the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), as a location (URL) or a name (URN), for indicating the resource on which a method is to be applied. Messages are passed in a format similar to that used by Internet Mail, and the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME).
</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;HTTP is also used as a generic protocol for communication between user agents and proxies/gateways to other Internet Protocols, such as SMTP, NNTP, FRP, Gopher, WAIS, allowing basic hypermedia access to resource available from diverse applications and simplifying the implementation of user agents.

</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>	&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hypertext Transfer Protocol is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information system. It is a generic, stateless, protocol which can be used for many tasks beyond its use for hypertext, such as name servers and distributed object management systems, through the extension of its request methods, error codes and headers. A feature of HTTP is the typing and negotiation of data representation, allowing systems to be built independently of the data being transferred.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hypertext Transfer Protocol is an application-level protocol distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. The first version of HTTP, referred to as HTTP/0.9, was a simple protocol for raw data transfer across the Internet. HTTP/1,0, as defined by RFC 1945, improved the protocol by allowing messages to be in the format of MIME-like messages, containing meta-information about the  data transferred and modifiers on the request/response semantics. However, HTTP/1.0 does not sufficiently take into consideration the effects of hierarchical proxies, caching, the need for persistent connections, or virtual hosts. In addition, the proliferation of incompletely-implemented applications calling themselves “HTP/1.0” has necessitated a protocol version change in order for two communicating applications to determine each other’s true capabilities.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;HTTP/1.1 includes more stringent requirements that HTTP/1.0 in order to ensure reliable implementations of its features.
	Practical information systems require more functionality than simple retrieval, including search, front-end update, and annotation. HTTP allows an open-ended set of methods and headers that indicate the purpose of a request. It builds on the discipline of reference provided by the Uniform Resource Identifier, as a location URL and as a name URN, for indicating the resource to which a method is to be applied. Messages are passed in a format similar to that used by Internet mail as define by the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions MIME.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;HTTO is also used as a generic protocol for communication between user agents and proxies/gateways to other internet systems, including those supported by the SMTP, FTP, Gopher, NNTP, and WAIS protocols. In this way, HTTP allows basic hypermedia access to resources available from diverse applications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The HTTP protocol us a request/response protocol.  A client sends a request to the server in the form of a request method, URI, and protocol version, followed by MIME-like message containing request modifiers, client information, and possible body content over a connection with a server. The server responds with a status line, including the message’s protocol version and a success or error code, followed by a MIME-like message containing server information, entity metainformation, and possible entity-body content.</p>

                        <li><p>HTTP 2 (RFC 7540 May 2015)

</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>	&nbsp;&nbsp;HTTP/2 is a major revision of the HTTP network protocol used by the World Wide Web. It was developed from the earlier experimental SPDY protocol, originally developed by Google. HTTP/2 was developed by the Hypertext transfer Protocol working group httpbis (where bis means ‘second”) of the IETF.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The standardization effort was supported by Chrome, Opera, Firefox, IE 11, Safar, Amazon Silk, and Edge browsers.
The proposed changes do not require any changes to how existing web applications work, but new applications can take advantage go new features for increased speed.
</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;HTTP/2 leaves most of HTTP 1.1’s high-level syntax, such as methods, status codes, header fields, and URIs, the same. The element that is modified is how the data is framed and transported between the client and the server.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;HTTP/2 allows the server to “push” content, that is, to respond with data for more queries than the client requested. This allows the server to supply data it knows a web browser will need to render the web page, without waiting for the browser to examine the first response, and without the overhead of an additional request cycle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional performance improvements in the first draft of HTTP/2 come from multiplexing of requests and responses to avoid the head-of-line blocking problem in HTTP 1 (even when HTTP pipelining is used), header compression, and prioritization of requests.</p>

            <li>Accept-Encoding - similar to Accept, but restricts the content-codings (section 3.5) that are acceptable in the response.</li>
            <li>Accept-Language - is similar to Accept, but restricts the set of natural languages that are preferred as a response to the request.</li>
            <li>Authorization - consists of credentials containing the authentication information of the user agent for the realm of the resource being requested</li>
            <li>Expect - is used to indicate that particular server behaviors are required by the client</li>
            <li>From - if given, SHOULD contain an Internet e-mail address for the human user who controls the requesting user agent</li>
            <li>Host - specifies the Internet host and port number of the resource being requested, as obtained from the original URI given by the user or referring resource</li>
            <li>If-match - is used with a method to make it conditional.</li>
            <li>If-Modified-Since - is used with a method to make it conditional: if the requested variant has not been modified since the time specified in this field, an entity will not be returned from the server; instead, a 304 (not modified) response will be returned without any message-body</li>
            <li>If-None-Match - is used with a method to make it conditional</li>
            <li>If-Unmodified-Since - is used with a method to make it conditional.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>If the requested resource has not been modified since the time specified in this field, the server SHOULD perform the requested operation as if the If-Unmodified-Since header were not present.</li>
              </ul>
            <li>Max-Forwards - provides a mechanism with the TRACE (section 9.8) and OPTIONS (section 9.2) methods to limit the number of proxies or gateways that can forward the request to the next inbound server.</li>
            <li>Proxy-Authorization - allows the client to identify itself (or its user) to a proxy which requires authentication</li>
            <li>Referer - request-header field allows the client to specify, for the server's benefit, the address (URI) of the resource from which the Request-URI was obtained</li>

            <li>Accept-Ranges - allows the server to indicate its acceptance of range requests for a resource</li>
            <li>Age - conveys the sender's estimate of the amount of time since the response (or its revalidation) was generated at the origin server</li>
            <li>E-Tag - provides the current value of the entity tag for the requested variant</li>
            <li>Location -is used to redirect the recipient to a location other than the Request-URI for completion of the request or identification of a new resource</li>
            <li>Retry-after - can be used with a 503 (Service Unavailable) response to indicate how long the service is expected to be unavailable to the requesting client</li>
            <li>Server - contains information about the software used by the origin server to handle the request</li>
            <li>Vary - indicates the set of request-header fields that fully determines, while the response is fresh, whether a cache is permitted to use the response to reply to a subsequent request without revalidation</li>
            <li>WWW-Authentication - MUST be included in 401 (Unauthorized) response messages. The field value consists of at least one challenge that indicates the authentication scheme(s) and parameters applicable to the Request-URI</li>

                <li>300 Multiple Choices - The requested resource corresponds to any one of a set of representations, each with its own specific location, and agent-driven negotiation information (section 12) is being provided so that the user (or user agent) can select a preferred representation and redirect its request to that location.</li>
                <li>301 Moved Permanently - The requested resource has been assigned a new permanent URI and any future references to this resource SHOULD use one of the returned URIs.</li>
                <li>302 Found - The requested resource resides temporarily under a different URI.</li>
                <li>303 See Other - The response to the request can be found under a different URI and SHOULD be retrieved using a GET method on that resource.</li>
                <li>304 Not Modified - If the client has performed a conditional GET request and access is allowed, but the document has not been modified, the server SHOULD respond with this status code.</li>
                <li>305 Use Proxy - The requested resource MUST be accessed through the proxy given by the Location field.</li>
                <li>306 (Unused) - The 306 status code was used in a previous version of the specification, is no longer used, and the code is reserved.</li>

                <li>406 Not Acceptable - The resource identified by the request is only capable of generating response entities which have content characteristics not acceptable according to the accept headers sent in the request.</li>
                <li>407 Proxy Authentication Required - This code is similar to 401 (Unauthorized), but indicates that the client must first authenticate itself with the proxy.</li>
                <li>408 Request Timeout - The client did not produce a request within the time that the server was prepared to wait.
                <li>409 Conflict - The request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the resource.</li>

                <li>413 Request Entity Too Large - The server is refusing to process a request because the request entity is larger than the server is willing or able to process.</li>
                <li>414 Request-URI Too Long - The server is refusing to service the request because the Request-URI is longer than the server is willing to interpret.</li>
                <li>415 Unsupported Media Type - The server is refusing to service the request because the entity of the request is in a format not supported by the requested resource for the requested method.</li>
                <li>416 Requested Range Not Satisfiable - A server SHOULD return a response with this status code if a request  included a Range request-header field.</li>
                <li>417 Expectation Failed - The expectation given in an Expect request-header field (see section   14.20) could not be met by this server. </li>
